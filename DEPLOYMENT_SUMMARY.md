## What You Need to Do Now

### 1. Test Integration Locally (15 minutes)

#### Step 1: Get JWT Token from Django
```bash
# Django login endpoint: POST /api/v1/login
# If Django is running locally:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","password":"testpass"}'

# Copy the "access" token
```

#### Step 2: Run Integration Tests
```powershell
# Start your server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run integration tests
node test-integration.js <PASTE_TOKEN_HERE>
```

**Expected Result:**
```
🧪 Starting Integration Tests

Test 1: Health Check...
✓ Health check passed

Test 2: API Info Endpoint...
✓ API info retrieved

...

Test Summary:
Total Tests: 8
Passed: 8
Failed: 0

🎉 All tests passed! Integration is working correctly.
```

---

### 2. Create Production Branch (5 minutes)

```powershell
# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: add deployment configuration and documentation"

# Push develop branch
git push origin develop

# Create main branch (production)
git checkout -b main
git push origin main

# Set main as default branch on GitHub
# Go to: Settings → Branches → Change default branch to 'main'

# Go back to develop for future work
git checkout develop
```

---

### 3. Share with Teams (10 minutes)

#### To Django Team:
```
Hi Django Team! 👋

The opportunities service is ready for integration. I've confirmed the JWT_SECRET is configured.

Can you verify:
1. Your JWT tokens include the 'user_id' field
2. The JWT_SECRET we're using matches yours exactly
3. CORS is configured to allow requests from our Node.js service

Once confirmed, we can proceed to deployment testing.

Thanks!
```

### 5. Deployment Options

#### Option A: Manual Deployment
```bash
# SSH to production server
ssh user@opportunities.varsigram.com

# Follow DEVOPS_CHECKLIST.md
cd /var/www/opportunities-service
./deploy.sh production
```

#### Option B: GitHub Actions (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Add GitHub secrets:
#    - JWT_SECRET
#    - PRODUCTION_HOST
#    - PRODUCTION_USER
#    - SSH_PRIVATE_KEY

# 2. Push to main branch
