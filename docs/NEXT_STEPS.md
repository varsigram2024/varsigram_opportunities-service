# üöÄ Next Steps - Integration & Deployment

## Current Status
‚úÖ Django backend configured  
‚úÖ Node.js service built with auth integration  
‚è≥ Need to get JWT_SECRET and test integration  
‚è≥ Need to create main branch  
‚è≥ Need to deploy  

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do These Now)

### 1. Get JWT_SECRET from Django Team

**Send this message:**
```
Hi! You mentioned you've completed the Django setup. Great!

I need the JWT_SECRET to complete the integration. Can you share it 
securely? (Password manager, encrypted message, etc.)

Also, can you send me:
1. A sample JWT token (or test user credentials)
2. The login endpoint URL
3. Confirm the token includes 'user_id' field

Thanks!
```

**Once you receive JWT_SECRET:**
```bash
# Add to your .env file
echo "JWT_SECRET=<value-from-django-team>" >> .env
```

---

### 2. Test Integration with Django

#### Step 1: Get JWT Token from Django
```bash
# Ask Django team for their login endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "testuser", "password": "testpass"}'

# Copy the "access" token from response
```

#### Step 2: Verify Token Structure
```bash
# Go to https://jwt.io
# Paste the token
# Verify it contains:
{
  "user_id": "some-uuid-here",  ‚Üê MUST HAVE THIS!
  "email": "user@example.com",
  ...
}
```

#### Step 3: Test with Your Node.js Service
```bash
# Start your server
npm run dev

# Test creating an opportunity with Django's token
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/opportunities \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <PASTE_TOKEN_HERE>" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Integration",
    "description": "Testing Django + Node.js integration",
    "category": "INTERNSHIP",
    "location": "Lagos"
  }'

# Should return success with created opportunity!
```

#### Step 4: Verify in Database
```bash
# Open Prisma Studio
npx prisma studio

# Check opportunities table
# Verify createdBy field has the user_id from JWT token
```

---

### 3. Create Main Branch (Production Branch)

```bash
# Make sure all your work is committed
git status

# If there are uncommitted changes, commit them
git add .
git commit -m "Complete authentication integration with Django backend"

# Push current develop branch
git push origin develop

# Create main branch from develop
git checkout -b main
git push origin main

# Set main as default branch on GitHub
# Go to: Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Change default branch to 'main'

# Go back to develop for future work
git checkout develop
```

**Branch Strategy:**
- `main` - Production-ready code (deploy from here)
- `develop` - Active development (work here)
- `feature/*` - New features (merge to develop)

---

### 4. Update Environment Variables

#### Development `.env`:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/opportunities_dev_db
JWT_SECRET=<from-django-team>

# Django endpoints (local)
DJANGO_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

#### Production `.env.example`:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@prod-db:5432/opportunities_prod_db
JWT_SECRET=<same-as-django-production-secret>

# Django endpoints (production)
DJANGO_API_URL=https://api.varsigram.com
```

---

### 5. Prepare for Deployment

#### Create Production Build
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Test production build locally
npm start

# Verify it works
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

#### Create Deployment Documentation
```bash
# Already created! Share these with DevOps:
# - docs/checklists/DEVOPS_CHECKLIST.md
# - docs/DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md
# - .env.example (for environment variables)
```

## CHECKLIST: What You Need from Django Team

Copy and send this to Django developer:

```markdown
Hi! Thanks for completing the Django setup. I need the following to complete integration:

**Critical:**
- [ ] JWT_SECRET (share securely via password manager)
- [ ] Test user credentials (username, password, user_id)
- [ ] Login endpoint URL (dev: http://localhost:8000/api/auth/???)
- [ ] Production API domain (https://api.varsigram.com?)

**Verification:**
- [ ] JWT token includes 'user_id' field (please send sample token)
- [ ] CORS configured to allow Node.js requests
- [ ] Django deployed or ready to deploy

**For Testing:**
Can you test the login endpoint and share:
1. A sample JWT token
2. The decoded payload (so I can verify user_id is there)

Thanks!
```

---

## TESTING WORKFLOW

### Local Testing (Do This First)
```bash
# 1. Start PostgreSQL
# Make sure your local PostgreSQL is running

# 2. Run migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# 3. Start Node.js service
npm run dev
# Server should start on http://localhost:3000

# 4. Test health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# Should return: {"status":"OK","service":"Opportunities-service",...}

# 5. Test public endpoints (no auth)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/opportunities
# Should return list of opportunities (or empty array)

# 6. Get token from Django
# Ask Django team to help you get a token

# 7. Test protected endpoints (with auth)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/opportunities \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test","description":"Test","category":"INTERNSHIP"}'
# Should create opportunity successfully!
```

### Integration Testing
```bash
# Run full integration tests
npm test

# If tests fail, check:
# 1. JWT_SECRET is correct
# 2. Database is running
# 3. Environment variables are set
```

---

## GIT WORKFLOW GOING FORWARD

### For New Features:
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# 3. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
# Create Pull Request on GitHub: feature/my-new-feature ‚Üí develop

# 4. After PR is merged to develop, merge to main for production
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main
```

---

## DEPLOYMENT STEPS (When Ready)

### Option 1: Manual Deployment (Quick Start)

**Share with DevOps:**
```bash
# 1. Environment variables needed (see .env.example)
JWT_SECRET=<value>
DATABASE_URL=<production-db-url>
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000

# 2. Build commands
npm install
npm run build
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 3. Start command
npm start
# Or with PM2: pm2 start dist/index.js --name opportunities-api

# 4. Health check
curl https://opportunities.varsigram.com/health
```

### Option 2: CI/CD Pipeline (Recommended)

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - name: Install and Build
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run build
          npm test
      
      - name: Deploy
        # Add your deployment steps here
        # SSH to server, pull code, restart service, etc.
```

## NEXT IMMEDIATE STEP

**Right now, send this message to Django team:**

```
Hi Django team! üëã

Great work on completing the Django setup!

To complete the Node.js integration, I need:

1. JWT_SECRET (please share securely)
2. Test user credentials
3. Login endpoint URL
4. Confirm JWT token includes 'user_id' field

Once I have these, I can:

Can you provide these today?

Thanks!
```
